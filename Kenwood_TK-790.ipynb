    "*This article is about repurposing inexpensive Kenwood TK-790 land-mobile radios for amateur packet radio.  It is geared towards radio amateurs that have access to a 3D printer.  In this article we will discuss the benefits of this radio as well its challenges.  We will provide an overview of the various models that are available and point out which ones are suitable for ham use.  We will then go into the process of powering on the radio, connecting a speaker, configuring the hardware for 9600 baud use, programming it, connecting it to a TNC, and building custom programmers and microphones with the aid of a 3D printer.*\n",

    "The Kenwood TK-x90 radios are a discontinued series of land-mobile radios which were used extensively in public safety (police/fire) in the US.  These are solid, mil-spec quality radios.  These radios are being phased out in lieu of digital radios.  They are currently available in the second-hand market in the US for $30-60, depending on condition.  These are mono-band radios.  The VHF models can be converted to work on the amateur 2m band, making them an inexpensive option for a rugged, dedicated APRS radio.\n",
    "\n",
    "These radios are also 9600-baud capable, making them an ideal candidate for setting up inexpensive 9600 baud packet stations.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of reasons that a radio of this quality sells as cheaply as it does.  These radios do present some challenges when it comes to pressing them into service.  But with these challenges comes an opportunity to pick up a great radio at a reasonable price.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this article is to go through the various issues one might face with the TK-790, how to overcome them, and hopefully provide some inspiration for radio amateurs to build upon this work.  In this article you will find open hardware designs for a programmer circuit and 3D-printable custom connectors.  The result will be putting a rugged, high-quality radio into service for very little money.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will go over the features of the radio, how to program it for the 2m ham band, how to set it up as a dedicated APRS/packet radio, what is needed to make it work at 9600 baud, and touch on opportunities for further experimentation and development.\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of this work, we introduce open 3D-printable designs for basic and advanced programmers, packet radio connector for the Mobilinkd TNC3, and a microphone connector.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "This article assumes you can read and understand basic schematic diagrams.\n",
    "\n",
    "The how-to sections assume you have a soldering iron, can build your own cables, and can create basic circuits on a breadboard.  We will be using a 3D printer to create custom connectors.  Advanced users may build a programmer using a custom PCB with surface-mount components.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will likely need to change some configuration resistors on the control board.  This will require removing and re-soldering 1206 imperial / 3216 metric sized surface mount components.  This can be done with a soldering iron, but a hot-air rework station is an ideal tool if one is available.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using Linux and Wine to run the programming software to program the radio.  One assumes this software can be run directly under Windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "The article assumes you will be connecting the radio to a Mobilinkd TNC3, and that you have another APRS-capable transceiver for testing. You should also have a dummy load capable of handling at least 50W, and an RTL SDR to monitor the RF output.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "After exploring the Motorola SM50 and being unable to get it to work at 9600 baud, I decided to try a radio that was much more likely to work at 9600 baud.  Reading the specs in the Kenwood TK-790 service manual convinced me that, while not guaranteed, that it would very likely work.  And it would certainly work at 1200 baud, still being good value for a dedicated 45W mobile APRS radio.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, one of the bigger challenges is that the connector used for the microphone and programming interface is proprietary to Kenwood, and apparently only ever used on this series of radios.  Because of this, even used microphones in poor condition can sell for ovre $50 USD.  An after-market programmer available for this radio fetches a premium at $30-40, more than the radio itself can sometimes be found for.\n",
    "\n",
    "It really does not make sense to buy a TK-790, and then go out an buy all of the accessories needed to make it a functional radio.  The accessories for this radio are expensive.  Decent used amateur radios can be had for the money that you would spend on these items.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make this a cost-effective radio, we need to invest a little time and effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overcoming Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dig into the details of this radio, it might be helpful to lay out the challenges we face adapting this radio to amateur use, and then looking at how we might overcome these challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenges that I faced when investigating this radio and later adapting it to amateur packet use were the following:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Confusing model numbers and product configurations\n",
    " * Lack of amateur resources -- not many posts or videos\n",
    "   * No programming instructions\n",
    "   * No programming software \n",
    " * No built-in speaker\n",
    " * Expensive accessories\n",
    " * Proprietary connector\n",
    " * Would not power on\n",
    " * Surface-mount configuration resistors\n",
    "\n",
    "These challenges put many people off and are really what makes this radio a good value.  If it was easy, these radios would sell for a lot more money.  As an aside, as recently as 2009, these radios were being [sold for 1825 USD](http://www.state.wv.us/admin/purchase/bids/FY2009/B_PTR09038_02.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope start to address the first two issues with this article, by providing a reference for other radio amateurs to build upon and help clear up some of the confusion for first-time buyers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lack of a built-in speaker is often not a concern for packet use, but we will address it here by making an inexpensive adapter so the radio can be easily connected to an external speaker.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next two items are distinctly related, and are a major reason that these sell so cheaply.  The connector used on the radio for the programmer and microphone is unique to this series, making programmers and mics quite expensive.  We will need to be a bit inventive to address this.  While not exactly a household item, many amateur operators have access to 3D printers today.  With this, we can make our own mating connectors for programming the radio (and which can be adapted to use with a microphone).\n",
    "\n",
    "The remaining two items are also related. We will go into the configuration changes needed to make the radio usable for the average amateur.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Open Hardware\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the hardware designs in this article are released as open-source hardware (OSHW).\n",
    "\n",
    " * KiCAD designs (schematic and PCB) for a programmer circuit.\n",
    " * FreeCAD designs for the custom connectors for the programmer and microphone.\n",
    " \n",
    "These items are licensed under the [CC-BY-SA](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/), the same license that this article carries.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am not an experienced 3D modeler or mechanical engineer, nor do I have the tools to accurately measure the connector dimensions or product mechanical drawings.  The connector design is one area that could benefit from further contribution by radio amateurs with the proper tools and skillset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## TK-x90\n",
    "\n",
    "The TK-x90 series is made up of the TK-690, TK-790, and TK-890 models.  There are multiple variants of each of these that cover different segments of the VHF low band (TK-690), VHF high band (TK-790) and UHF band (TK-890).  There are \"H\" variants of these radios that put out 100W rather than the 40-50W the non-H models are rated at.\n",
    "\n",
    "Full service manuals for all of the models in the series are available at the [Repeater Builder website](http://www.repeater-builder.com/kenwood/kenwood-index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the challenges of buying these radios is the confusion that can arise from all of the models, variants and components that are available.  Read through this section and understand the radios and components that are for sale before buying a radio (or what you might think is a radio).  We are going to cover the models in this series, the variants of each model, and the control heads that are available for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### KRK-5 Separation Kits\n",
    "\n",
    "**A word of warning for the impatient.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of these radios, especially the \"H\" variants, are sold with a control head separation kit.  It is very common to find just the control head for sale, without a radio, or a radio for sale without a control head.  Rarely with either come with the separation cable, which can cost more than the used radio.  I recommend staying away from these as one can rarely find a bargain buying these components separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Buy a 45W radio with the control head attached.  That is what is covered in this article.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Models\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three major models each with multiple variants.  There are also normal (45W) and \"H\" (100W) variants.  We will go into these in detail below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The major models to be aware of are:\n",
    "\n",
    " * TK-690 -- VHF low-band (29.7-50MHz), three variants, generally considered unusable for ham bands\n",
    " * TK-790 -- VHF high-band (136-174MHz), two variants, usable on 2m\n",
    " * TK-890 -- UHF (403-512MHz), three variants, only one known usable on 70cm\n",
    " \n",
    "We will not be covering the \"H\" variants here.  The majority of these are sold without a control head, and adding a control head and cable can cost more than the radio.  There are a lot of traps one can fall in with these radios, and covering them all would take a complete article in itself.  Let's just say that if you buy an \"H\" model, do not be surprised to find that you have an inert piece of metal on your hands.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also two control heads available for these units.  They are often sold as separate items (primarily for the \"H\" variants).\n",
    "\n",
    "    The first trap to avoid when buying one of these radios is making sure you\n",
    "    are buying a full radio with control head and not just the control head.\n",
    "\n",
    "We cover the two control heads below.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### TK-690\n",
    "\n",
    "The TK-690s are here just for completeness.  Online posts suggest that they are unusable for the ham bands without re-tuning the RF circuits.  That is well beyond the scope of this article.  There are three variants, and only appear to be available in the H version.\n",
    "\n",

    " * https://fccid.io/ALH22923130 TK-690H 110W 39-50 MHz\n",
    "\n",
    "These have very little value on the secondary market.  The '110 or '130 variants might be interesting projects for the adventurous ham experimenter.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### TK-790\n",
    "\n",
    "This model is the focus of this article.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two variants of the TK-790.  I have only seen the 148-174MHz variant.  The second variant would be ideal for amateur use, but the first model works well on the 2m band.\n",
    "\n",

    "#### TK-890\n",
    "\n",
    "The TK-890 is the UHF version of this radio.  There are three variants and only one is known to be usable for the 70cm amateur band.  This would be useful for setting up a 9600 baud packet network on 70cm.  I have only tried to use these on the upper half of the band.  However, this model is not the focus of this article.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Control Heads\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two control heads available for these radios, the KCH-10 basic control head, and the KCH-11 advanced control head.  The major difference is that the basic control head has a built-in speaker and fewer buttons, while the advanced control head has more buttons but does not have a speaker.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key aspects of the control head is the proprietary 12-pin connector on the front.  This connector is used for programming and for the microphone connection.\n",
    "\n",

    "  </tr>\n",
    "</table>\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic control is probably the most useful for amateur radio use as it has a built-in speaker.  My experience is that these are quite a bit less common than the KCH-11.  However, one of the more noticeable limitations of this control head is that it can display fewer characters on its display.\n",

    "</table>\n",
    "\n",
    "The advanced control head is the more common control head found on these radios.  These have a larger display screen and 6 more buttons than the KCH-10.  To get the added buttons and screen size, it gives up the speaker.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want speaker output from the radio, you will need to connect an external speaker to the 9-pin Molex connector on the rear of the radio.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12-pin Connector\n",
    "\n",
    "*Some of the measurements below are approximate.  I do not have the equipment to measure this accurately.  My measurements were accurate enough for 3D-printed models and PCB construction.*\n",

    "The male end (a somewhat arbitrary distinction) is on the radio.  It has pogo pins (spring-loaded pins) that project out of the face of the connector.\n",
    "\n",
    "The female end is on the accessory (programmer or microphone).  It has pads that make contact with the pins on the radio.\n",
    "\n",
    "The female connector has an outer shell and a recessed inner contact area, and a central locator pin.\n",
    "\n",
    "The outer shell has a diameter of roughly 19.5mm and an inner diameter of 17.5mm.  The outer shell is 1mm thick.  The wall of the outer shell protrudes 5.4mm from the contact base.  The center pin is 4mm in diameter and extends 10mm from the contact base. The 12 pads on the contact base are offset from one another by 30 degrees.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pads can be thought of as two concentric rings of 6 pins each in a hexagon (60° offset), offset from one another by 30°.  The outer ring has a radius of 6mm.  The inner ring has a radius of 4.5mm.  The inner ring is rotated 30° from the outer ring.\n",
    "\n",
    "The male connector on the radio has pogo pins which protrude from the face of the connector.  Each pins is about 0.85mm in diameter with about 1.5mm of travel.  In the center of the connector is a locator hole.\n",
    "\n",
    "The connector is held in place with an M2.5 screw with a depth of about 5mm.  The screw hole is at 225° angle and about 14mm from the center.  The screw hole sits 2.5mm higher than the face of the connector with the pogo pins.\n",

    "### A Note on Buying\n",
    "\n",
    "You may find radios that are advertised as \"parts only\" with the comment that it will not power on.  This is not uncommon for these radios as they are very frequently configured for *ignition sense*.  Without the proper cable attached, they will not power on.  Ignition sense can either be provided by applying power to one of the pins of the 9-pin Molex connector on the back, or it can be disabled by changing a configuration resistor on the control board.  We will show how to deal with both below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Accessories\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we are going to cover the accessories needed to get started with this radio.  Many of them we are going to make ourselves, because it is cost-effective to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to need the following to get started:\n",
    "\n",
    " * power cable (these are available for under $10)\n",
    " * programmer (a breadboard and a 3D-printed connector)\n",
    " * TNC adapter/connector\n",
    "\n",
    "We are also going to cover the optional items:\n",
    "\n",
    " * ignition sense connector\n",
    " * speaker connector\n",
    " * microphone\n",

    "The way this section is organized we will be looking not just at the accessory itself, but any modifications we need to make to the radio to use those accessories.  For example, in the section on the power cable, we are going to go through the process of powering up the radio, and talking about ignition sense and how to disable it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the complete BOM needed to power on the radio, program it, connect it to a TNC and connect a speaker.  Additional items will be needed if you want to make a more permanent programmer cable or microphone.  These are addressed separately below.\n",

    "\n",
    "The power connector is a two-pin square connector common to 45W and under radios from Kenwood and others.  Power cables for these radios are available and for a reasonable price.  These radios use the same power connector as my Kenwood TM-V71A.  These are \"standard\" connectors in the sense that a number of radio manufacturers seem to use them, but they are not made by a common connector company (i.e. they are not Molex connectors).  You can find them in China.\n",

    "\n",
    "It's usually more convenient to buy a pre-made cable for $10-20.  I recommend the ones with inline fuses.  These are a requirement if you intend to connect it directly to an automobile's power system and use *ignition sense* to control the radio's power.\n",
    "\n",
